"""Confidence thresholds for the Prompting phase.

The five support levels and their cutoff values are the project's required
LITERAL specification (0.77 / 0.83 / 0.89 / 0.96). They are applied to the
real cross-encoder rerank score (0..1) returned by the project's Reranker —
never approximated, never changed, never averaged.

Aggregation rule (as required):
- per chunk: max rerank score across all sub-queries that retrieved it;
- per claim: min over the supporting chunks of the claim;
- overall answer: min over all retained claims.
